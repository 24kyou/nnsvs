## Notice 

### 2020/04/20

This is my hobby project. I have an prototype of singing voice synthesis system locally, and plan to make it open source and continue to improve it. At the moment I was writing this, the project is still quite far from my goal. Software design is not fixed yet, and lots of fundamental problems are remained unsolved (e.g., accurate F0 prediction including vibrate parameter estimation). Please understand that this is my personal project and I may be slow to make progress. That said, I am excited to learn singing voice synthesis technology and make an useful open-source tool for it. If you have any requests or comments, please let me know and I would apprecaite your contribution.

## What (to be)

PyTorch-based singing voice synthesis (SVS) library for research purposes. We’ll focus on the research advancement of the singing voice synthesis technology.

## Background

As of Feb. 2020, [NEUTRINO](https://n3utrino.work/), a DNN-based singing voice synthesis tool, has started gaining its popularity in Japan. Because of the powerful DNN-based approach, users can create expressive and natural singing voices even without manual tuning which is typically required to achieve satisfactory quality using the existing tools.

While NEUTRINO is a great tool for creative purposes, it is not open-source software. In fact, there are only a few open-source toolkits to the best of our knowledge. To advance the singing voice synthesis research, we aim to provide a modern DNN-based singing voice synthesis tool for researchers and developers.

That being said, I was just curious to see if I can make a better one than NEUTRINO. We’ll see :)
